The first ever SMS-controlled digital kiosk which allows users to select and view category-specific content on a poster-sized Treo using their mobile device. Kiosks were outdoors, usually inside bus shelters. Each kiosk had a computer with a Flash application installed. The Flash app would then communicate with the central application hosted by us at AKQA. Application development included a custom J2EE app to manage incoming text messages (from the mobile gateway) as well as to prepare the localized, dynamic content coming from live data services (weather, news, movies, etc.)
