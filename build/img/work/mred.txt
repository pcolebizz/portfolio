Microsoft came to AKQA to design and build a global, in-store kiosk to support the release of their new operating system, Windows Vista. The final application was distributed around the world to stores such as Best Buy. Built in Microsoft's new WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation), it included 3D animation (using custom 3D engines), audio, video, custom installation software, user data tacking, and it was architected to be easily localized in any language; pulling in all content dynamically: Text, images, video, etc.
